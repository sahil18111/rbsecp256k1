Notable Changes
===============

This release makes a couple of developer experience updates to the library. It
adds a new exception hierarchy that will allow users to library to better catch
and handle errors generated by the library. It also removes some clunky code
related to generating randomness during context initialization. As a result,
`Context#new` now allows users to provide 32-bytes of randomness from whatever
source they like. If these bytes are not provided then the context is not
randomized. `Context#create` creates a new context using 32-bytes of randomness
from Ruby's `SecureRandom`. `Context#create` is now the canonical and
recommended way to create a new context.

### Library Updates

The following updates were made to the library:

* Allow users to provide randomness at context initialization ([#40](https://github.com/etscrivner/rbsecp256k1/issues/40))
* Create and use a library exception hierarchy ([#41](https://github.com/etscrivner/rbsecp256k1/issues/41))
